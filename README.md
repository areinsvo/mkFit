Matevz's notes during bringing the Matriplex back in
====================================================

What's with other branches?
mt-devel is the branch I was working off before splitting off Matriplex so we
could eventually get rid of it (once I finish the merge).
Is something useful still on conformal-fit?

We need some sort of steering code, I started working on this in
mtorture/mkFit ... but probably has to be more general.
